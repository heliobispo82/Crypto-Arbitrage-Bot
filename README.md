# Crypto Arbitrage Bot

Welcome to the Crypto Arbitrage Bot repository. This bot is designed to identify and capitalize on cryptocurrency arbitrage opportunities between multiple exchanges. It uses the CCXT library to interact with different exchanges and execute trades automatically.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of cryptocurrency prices on supported exchanges.
- Detection of arbitrage opportunities based on a configurable profit threshold.
- Implementation of a trailing stop mechanism to secure profits.
- Circuit breaker to handle extreme market volatility or exchange issues.
- Detailed logging and reporting for performance tracking and error handling.

## Prerequisites

Before using this bot, you need to have the following:

1. API keys and secrets for the cryptocurrency exchanges you plan to use.
2. Python installed on your machine.
3. The CCXT library. You can install it using pip: `pip install ccxt`.
4. Configuration of the `config.py` file with your API keys and settings.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the `config.py` file with your API keys and settings.
3. Run the `crypto_arb_bot.py` script to start the bot.
4. The bot will continuously monitor the selected trading pairs and execute arbitrage trades when profitable opportunities are found.

## Configuration

You can configure various settings in the `config.py` file, including:

- API keys and secrets for supported exchanges.
- Trading parameters, such as trade amount, profit threshold, and trailing stop percentage.

## Logging and Reporting

The bot logs all activities, including trade executions, errors, and important events, to a log file. You can review the log file (`arb_bot.log`) for a detailed history of bot actions.

For more comprehensive reporting and analysis, consider exporting the bot's data to a database or using additional reporting tools.

## Safety Measures

The bot includes a circuit breaker that halts trading in the event of extreme market volatility or exchange issues. The circuit breaker can be customized in the `config.py` file.
